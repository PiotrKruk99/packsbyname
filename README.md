# packsbyname
Project for searching ArchLinux repositories only by packages name.

Tool should be used by invoking script file with phrase to search in packages names:

./packsbyname.sh [phrase to search]

'dotnet-sdk-3.1' or higher and 'yay' is necessary to run project. You can use Pacman instead of Yay (or another package manager) by adjustment 'packsbyname.sh'.
